## Introduction {#intro}

Baseball is a captivating sport that is a big part of American culture. Besides its ability to keep many entertained, baseball is also rich in data with many opportunities to conduct statistical analyses. Each play contains information that can be interpreted and used within a  multilevel data modeling structure. Our motivation for choosing this data set was our interest in the sport, as well as the analytical opportunities and our curiosity in uncovering unique trends that influence the trajectory of the game.

One factor of baseball games we found intriguing was variability in hit distance. We were interested in exploring this further as well as the potential variables that influences a batter's hit distance. We have seen prior research focusing on factors like bat speed and bat velocity, but have seen fewer studies examining the impact of multilevel facotrs. To explore baseball games in a multilevel manner, we examined the batter's dominant arm as our level one variable and the specific attributes of a pitch such as angle, speed, and type as our level 2 variables. We also accounted for player to player variability by including batter as a random effect in our model. We hypothesized that individual differences in skill can yield significantly different outcomes.

Ultimately, our goal was to determine whether these factors, random effects, and interactions attribute to the outcome of a homerun, or a ball that is hit a far distance. We hypothesize that pitch angle and speed will significantly impact how far a ball travels. By examining this we hope to contribute to the field of baseball analytics and gain valuable insights to inform coaching and player development. 


## Data and Methods

![](STAT%20414%20Presentation.png)

### Data Description

-   Briefly describe your data, where your data came from (source), definitions of important variables, and how the data were collected. You should include a variables table and/or diagram representing your study.

    \*The data comes from Baseball Savant which records various aspects of plate appearances in MLB games. The data recorded games over the 2024 regular season from the beginning of April through June. This documentation was available at [**Baseball Savant**](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs) and can be downloaded at [**Share Point**](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/brian_macdonald_yale_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fbrian%5Fmacdonald%5Fyale%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fservice%2FCSAS%2F2025%2D04%2D11%20%2D%20CSAS%20at%20Yale%2Fdata%2Echallenge%2Fdata&ga=1)**.** The data was collected from a Statcast system which includes various cameras that are dedicated to tracking quantitative data from plate appearances with respect to both the pitcher and the batter in addition to data on the game states. In the dataset, there are over 90 variables about all aspects of an MLB game, but through literary analysis and with our goal of using variables that are directly observable from a batter’s role, we reduced our model to include launch_angle_gmc (the launch angle of the ball off the swing), launch_angle_gmc$^2$ (squared term for launch angle of the ball, to account for curve in the data), launch_speed_gmc (the launch speed of the ball off the swing), batter (the batter’s preferred stance side), is_fastball (whether a pitch was a type fastball or not), and p_throws (which arm a pitcher threw with). These variables are displayed in the above image.

Initially the data had 346,250 observations, but we filtered it so that only observations on balls that were hit into play remained, and NA values removed as well, since these were mainly in variables that were more complex and simply not measured most of the time. This left us with 60,482 observations. We also filtered out hits that flew a distance of 0, as this did not make sense to us, since this would mean the ball fell straight down, as well as hits that had launch angles < 0, since hitting the ball at the ground would not cause it to travel far. All quantitative variables included were then grand mean centered so as to improve interpretability in the final model. Originally there had been a pitch_type variable, but during analysis we found that only the categories that represent fastball types (four-seam, two-seam, cutter) after dummification were statistically significant, so we recoded these to a single indicator variable is_fastball which has a 1 if the pitch was a fastball and 0 if not.


```{r}

         launch_speed_gmc = launch_speed - mean(launch_speed))|>

### Statistical Analysis

-   Briefly describe the methods you used (e.g., multilevel regression) in your analysis

-   Do not report results in this section!

## Results

-   Summarize the results of your exploratory data analysis (e.g., include a matrix plot?). Which Level 1 and Level 2 variables appeared to be most promising before you built your final model

```{r}
#| label: Matrix Plot for quantitative variables
num_vars <- final_data |>
  mutate(log_la = log(launch_angle_gmc),
         sqrt_ls = sqrt(launch_angle_gmc),
         launch_angle_sqd = launch_angle_gmc^2) |>
  select(hit_distance_sc, launch_angle_gmc, launch_speed_gmc, launch_angle_sqd)

ggpairs(num_vars, title = "Matrix Plot Between Numeric Predictors, Response", columnLabels = c("Hit Distance", "Launch Angle", "Launch Speed", "Launch Angle^2"))
```

```{r}
#| label: Categorical Analysis
# Maya ADD slide plots 

plot(allEffects(model11), main = "Stand Effects")

plot(effect(term="stand", mod=model11), xlab="Dominant Side", ylab="Hit Distance (ft)", main = "Dominant Side Effect")
plot(effect(term="is_fastball", mod=model11), xlab="Is a Fastball", ylab="Hit Distance (ft)", main = "Fastball Effect")
plot(effect(term="launch_angle_gmc*launch_speed_gmc", mod=model11), xlab="Launch Angle", ylab="Hit Distance (ft)", main="Launch Angle and Launch Speed Interaction Effect")
#change**
```

-   Summarize the results of your initial anova exploring the significance of the Level 2 grouping variable.

```{r}
model0 <- lm(hit_distance_sc ~ batter, data= final_data)
anova(model0)
```

-   Summarize, including (with a useful picture), your null model and what you learn, including interpreting the ICC value in context.

```{r}
#| label: Graph of variability between random 10 batters (number of hits)
#| fig-cap: "A random sample of 10 Batters in the dataset"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-pos: "H"
set.seed(7000)

top_batters <- final_data |>
  distinct(batter) |>  
  slice_sample(n = 10)  

filtered_data <- final_data |>
  filter(batter %in% top_batters$batter)  

ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = batter, y = hit_distance_sc)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distance Hit by Batter",
       x = "Batter ID",
       y = "Distance (ft)") +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
nullmodel <- lmer(hit_distance_sc ~ 1 + (1 | batter), data=final_data)
summary(nullmodel)

ICC::ICCbare(y=final_data$hit_distance_sc, x = final_data$batter)

logLik(nullmodel)
performance(nullmodel)
```

\$ \tau\_0\^2: \$ The batter to batter variance in average hit distance is 292.9.

\$ \sigma\^2: \$ The variance in average hit distance for each batter is 17985.5.

\$ \beta\_0: \$ The average hit distance across all batters is 164.116.

$$ ICC: \frac{292.9}{292.9 + 17985.5} = 0.01602438$$ The correlation between two hits by the same batter is .016. 1.6% of the variation is explained by within batter variation in hit distance rather than between batters. This is not substantial. The log likelihood of the null model is -384430.9. The deviance is 134.11 feet. The AIC is 7.689\*10\^5.

**ALL NEEDS TO BE CHANGED but should be interpretations\^\^\^\^**

-   Brief discussion of how you arrived at your final model. Interpret all of the estimated parameters in your final model in context. Include at least one confidence interval or interval of random slopes and interpret in context. (But there shouldn’t really be much “commentary” in this section.) How much of the unexplained Level 1 and/or Level 2 variation in the null model is explained by your final model?

-   Integrate the most relevant figures to help interpret the results with your discussion. This includes graphs illustrating fixed effects, random effects, and interactions.

-   These tables and figures should be well-labeled, numbered (e.g., Figure 1), and\
    have a good, descriptive caption.

-   Especially effective graphs compare your data to the model and discuss how the\
    model does and does not capture important features of the data. At least\
    consider showing the “effects plots” in addition to the raw data graphs.

-   Each report should have a minimum of two plots (could be several more, just\
    keep them well-sized and well-integrated into the discussion).

-   Diagnostic analysis: Discussion and inclusion of residual plots (with commentary) for your final model

## Discussion {#discussion}

Describe how the results help answer your research questions and what was most interesting from your analysis. In fact, the first paragraph of the Discussion is very important – in professional journals, it is often the first and sometimes the only paragraph that is read in a paper. After the first sentence highlights primary results, the remainder of the first paragraph might compare your results to others in the literature or include interesting secondary results.

-   Discuss possible implications of the results in the context of the research question.

-   Identify any limitations of your study. Discuss the potential impact of such limitations onthe conclusions. (e.g., potential confounding variables, generalizability - Don’t give generic statements of possible causation and generalizability, but thoughtfully discuss relevant issues – confounding variables, representativeness of the sample, etc.)

-   Identify strengths and weaknesses of your analysis.

-   Make suggestions for future research. Identify important next steps that a researcher could take to build on your work.
